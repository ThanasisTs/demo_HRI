# A Human Robot Interaction demo

This package combines the functionality of [movement_detection](https://github.com/ThanasisTs/movement_detection), [trajectory_process_utils](https://github.com/ThanasisTs/trajectory_process_utils), and [trajectory_execution_pkg](https://github.com/ThanasisTs/trajectory_execution_pkg) repos for a demonstration of our HRI framework. The initial trajectory is provided via a (csv)[https://github.com/ThanasisTs/demo_HRI/blob/master/csv/trajectory_example.csv] file.
