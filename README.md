# The ROS trajectory generation package

It includes a generic launch file for trajectory generation. It depends on the packages [movement_detection](https://github.com/thanasists/movement_detection)
and [trajectory_point_process](https://github.com/thanasists/trajectory_point_process).

In the first figure the the raw points and the filtered ones of a recorded trajectory are shown, while in the second one the filtered points and the corresponding smooth trajectory are presented. In the third figure a block diagram of the framework is shown.
